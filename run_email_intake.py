"""SACC-POC-Triage Email Intake Agent CLI entry point.

Fetch and enrich the latest email(s) from Microsoft Graph. No triage and
no classification here — that is handled by the Triage Agent.

Usage:
    python run_email_intake.py                # latest email only
    python run_email_intake.py --top 10       # up to 10 most recent emails
