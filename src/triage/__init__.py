"""SACC-POC-Triage: Standalone AP Invoice Triage Agent.

A production-ready pipeline that triages AP invoices using pure Python
classification and validation logic. No external API server required —
extraction data is passed in directly.

Optional: SAP AI Core for document classification via
GPT-5.4 vision (see ``triage.ai_core`` module) and SAP Document AI
for invoice field extraction (see ``triage.doc_ai`` module).

Public API::
